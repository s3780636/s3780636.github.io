						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					</header>
					<p> My name is Gokay Tilki and I am 18 years old. My student number is s3780636, my school email is s3780636@student.rmit.edu.au. My parents are both Turkish and I was born and raised in Australia. 
					   The languages I speak confidently are English and Turkish. My education started in 2006-2012 which were my primary school years, 2013-2018 was my high school years and now 2019-present is university.
					   As a kid I grew up on video games and they have stuck with me ever since. 
					   I mainly played games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield and anime games from titles such as Naruto and Dragonball. Listening to music is also quite a favourite hobby of mine.</p>

						<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
					</header>
					<p> I am currently a first year student at RMIT in the city and the course I am doing is Bachelor of Information Technology which is a 3 year course. The reason why I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in the city was because the layout of the campus
						has such a contemporary look and feel to it, which I love. The location is also very convenient as Melbourne Central is right next to the main buildings I have classes in. During my breaks Melbourne Central is the place I go to if I'm not studying or working on my assignments.
						My interest in IT came from the many hours a day I spent playing video games and on the computer. It's all I did growing up. I thought that I'd like to one day create my own games or software by coding/programming. As a gamer, I loved looking at gaming setups with all the cool tech
						that was available at the time and I'm pleased to say that my setup is looking quite good. I used to dream of having the best computers, coding away for hours on end, making my own games and I hope to get good enough to do so. </p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<p>My ideal job would be to work for video game giants such as Treyarch or Infinity Ward. The people behind my childhood favourite, Call of Duty. They both have a career section on their websites and the available position I found was at
						Infinity Ward. The link to the position is: https://www.glassdoor.com.au/job-listing/senior-online-programmer-infinity-ward-JV_IC1146915_KO0,24_KE25,38.htm?jl=2943189224&countryRedirect=true. They require you to have a minimum of 5 years experience with excellent C++ programming for games, a minimum of 2 published video game titles, some
						experience with online services such as Sony PSN, Xbox Live or Steam, packet bandwidth optimization and competency in client-server networking architecture. Currently I do not meet any of those qualifications except for having experience using the listed 
						online services. At the moment I wouldn't know where to start when asked to program a game, I wish for this to change in the near future. My plan to obtain the skills I am lacking is to look at C++ tutorials online to help me get started with learning the C language.
						I will need to learn how to start programming a video game and eventually lead to finishing a full game. I hope that the skills I obtain during university will be able to get me started with other programming languages. Although I would ideally like to be able to create my own games, learning the networking 
						side to video games is also important to me. The position in this advertisement requires you to implement high performance networking code solution for both the client side and server side game logic and to make the games' network traffic as optimal as it can be.</p>
