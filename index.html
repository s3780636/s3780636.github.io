						<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					</header>
					<p> My name is Gokay Tilki and I am 18 years old. My student number is s3780636, my school email is s3780636@student.rmit.edu.au. My parents are both Turkish and I was born and raised in Australia. 
					   The languages I speak confidently are English and Turkish. My education started in 2006-2012 which were my primary school years, 2013-2018 was my high school years and now 2019-present is university.
					   As a kid I grew up on video games and they have stuck with me ever since. 
					   I mainly played games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield and anime games from titles such as Naruto and Dragonball. Listening to music is also quite a favourite hobby of mine.</p>

						<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
					</header>
					<p> I am currently a first year student at RMIT in the city and the course I am doing is Bachelor of Information Technology which is a 3 year course. The reason why I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in the city was because the layout of the campus
						has such a contemporary look and feel to it, which I love. The location is also very convenient as Melbourne Central is right next to the main buildings I have classes in. During my breaks Melbourne Central is the place I go to if I'm not studying or working on my assignments.
						My interest in IT came from the many hours a day I spent playing video games and on the computer. It's all I did growing up. I thought that I'd like to one day create my own games or software by coding/programming. As a gamer, I loved looking at gaming setups with all the cool tech
						that was available at the time and I'm pleased to say that my setup is looking quite good. I used to dream of having the best computers, coding away for hours on end, making my own games and I hope to get good enough to do so. Technology has come a long way in the past 100 years and 
						it is only going to keep expanding. I would love to be a part of that expansion. I enjoy seeing how things work and how to make it better. Currently I have only seen the surface of Technology and I would like to dwell underneath. As a user you do not notice the work required to make that piece of
						technology work and I don't want to just be a user anymore. That's what really sparked my interest for IT.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<p>My ideal job would be to work for video game giants such as Treyarch or Infinity Ward. The people behind my childhood favourite, Call of Duty. They both have a career section on their websites and the available position I found was at
						Infinity Ward. The link to the position is: https://www.glassdoor.com.au/job-listing/senior-online-programmer-infinity-ward-JV_IC1146915_KO0,24_KE25,38.htm?jl=2943189224&countryRedirect=true. They require you to have a minimum of 5 years experience with excellent C++ programming for games, a minimum of 2 published video game titles, some
						experience with online services such as Sony PSN, Xbox Live or Steam, packet bandwidth optimization and competency in client-server networking architecture. Currently I do not meet any of those qualifications except for having experience using the listed 
						online services. At the moment I wouldn't know where to start when asked to program a game, I wish for this to change in the near future. My plan to obtain the skills I am lacking is to look at C++ tutorials online to help me get started with learning the C language.
						I will need to learn how to start programming a video game and eventually lead to finishing a full game. I hope that the skills I obtain during university will be able to get me started with other programming languages. Although I would ideally like to be able to create my own games, learning the networking 
						side to video games is also important to me. The position in this advertisement requires you to implement high performance networking code solution for both the client side and server side game logic and to make the games' network traffic as optimal as it can be.</p>

						<h2>Project Ideas.</h2>
						<p>I have not started any projects or really have proper ideas for some but I would like to eventually create my own game on Unreal Engine. 
						I have downloaded it before and tried messing around with it but I was lost. I had no clue what to do.
						The reason why I would like to use Unreal Engine is because very popular games have been made with it and has been around for just over 20 years.
						Games such as Fortnite, Gears of War, Tekken 7, Mortal Kombat X and many more. Unreal Engine is written in C++ meaning I will have to learn how to write in C++ before I start making my own games in UE.
						I hope that the coding skills I develop during my time at university will help in learning C++. The main type of video games I would love to create are fighting games like Tekken or first person shooters like Call of Duty.
						It has always been a dream of mine to make a Call of Duty game. As there is a very large majority of the world who play games, I hope to appeal to them by creating a good game with enjoyable content or at least be part of a team of people who create a game together.
						Statistics show that there are 2.2 billion gamers in the world and counting meaning there is a large demand for video games. I do not expect all 2.2 billion to play a game I create, got to start small. 
						Aim to please a minority, and the rest will follow. Video game popularity is increasing daily. Fortnite's Battle Royale mode took the world by storm, no pun intended, gathering a massive player base in such a short time.
						With brand new content every in-game season, it drew people in. Of those 2.2 billion it is estimated that almost half spend money while playing, imagine the money you could make if your game is successful. 
						Unreal Engine is not the only game engine on the market but with its user friendly interface it is the one I am opting for. You cannot really use Unreal Engine on low spec machines and is highly recommended you have a high end machine that will be able to handle the stress put on it by the range of 3D effects it has to offer.
						Render times will be drastically reduced if you have top of the range hardware compared to if you had low end components. You do not want your computer crashing mid render, causing you to lose the progress you made.
						As Unreal Engine is written in C++, I will have to learn the basics of it to at least get a start on a video game. You can find simple written tutorials in Unreal Engine but looking online for video tutorials for Unreal Engine and C++ will be able to provide a better understanding and explain things clearer.
						Anime like Dragonball Z, Naruto and One Piece all revolve around fighting, cool transformations and flashy abilities and I would like to create a game involving those. Games with good story lines appeal to me more than games with a better multiplayer experience.
						I love putting on my headphones and feeling like I've become one with the game I am playing. Games need to have really good score, sound effects and visuals otherwise they can be quite mundane. My goal is to make sure I make every aspect of the game loved by the user.
						I have spent too much money on games where I felt needed more but I have also played many games where I could not stop, like Destiny. Using that experience, I will know what to implement in to my games and what to leave out. If one day my creation becomes successful
						I will not stop at one. I will continue to produce more content.</p>

						<h2>Personal Profile.</h2>
						<p>The first test I have completed was the Myers-Briggs test. My results show that in the 'Mind' category I am 40 percent Extroverted and 60 percent Introverted, in the 'Energy' category I am 30 percent Intuitive and 70 percent observant, in the 'Nature'
							category I am 28 percent Thinking and 72 percent feeling, in the 'Tactics' category I am 71 percent judging and 29 percent Prospecting and in the final category 'Identity' I am 68 percent Assertive and 32 percent Turbulent.
							<br />
							<br />
							In the second test about my learning style, my results showed that my learning style is mainly Visual. With 15 percent Auditory, 50 percent Visual and 35 percent Tactile. 
							<br />
							<br />
							The third personality test revealed that I my Openness is 67 percent, meaning I tend to think creatively and explore different ideas, 73 percent Conscientious  meaning I am able to discipline myself to get things done, 44 percent
							Extraversion, 90 percent Agreeableness meaning I place the needs of others' before mine and finally 48 percent Neuroticisim which describes my tendancy to feel negative emotions. 
							<br />
							<br />
							The links to each of the tests I have completed are as follows: https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test, http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml and https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test. 
							<br />
							<br />
							I have completed many tests similar to these and usually the answers are the same or vary slightly. The way I act or think has not changed for a long time. I don't believe my personality or the way I learn is set in stone, with time they may change a little.
							When forming a team I believe it is desirable to have a variety of team members, not just like-minded people. A mixed variety of personalities and skills is needed in a group setting so that someone's strengths may be another's weakness. A team is meant for everyone help each other out, "There's no I in team".
							The results shown by the tests will not really alter the way I act in a team. I will act in a way where I feel comfortable, get work done whilst adhering to the rest of my team member's needs and respect them accordingly.</p>
